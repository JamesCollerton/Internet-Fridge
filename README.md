# Internet Fridge

This repository is split into two parts, an API and an App.

## API

This was developed as part of my university coursework. The idea was to take in requests in Python and then translate this into requests to a database. For example one thing might be to make a request saying 'What food have I got in my fridge, and what can I make?' The API then turns this into a call to the database to query it for recipes and results.

A video demonstrating the API can be found here:

## App

I then wanted to extend this idea into a full app. I started the basis of it with a MySQL database, nodeJS server and Android app, but it was a lot of work. It's still currently in development, but I haven't worked on it in a while
